my collegiate projects

The Stork-TheZoo Project was a project that opened a file and imported a list of animals for a zoo.
The user could add an animal, remove an animal, load the list, save the list and view the list.
The piece of code that I did particularaly well was the input and from the file.  With my method, the users can put in spaces in the name, and it will still have a valid input
I could enhance the code by turning it into a linked list rather than a vector.  I have a second version of the project where I tested making a linked list.
The most challenging part of this code was input verification from the user.  There are so many inputs that the user can enter that you have to make sure was input correctly.
To help me with this project, I used my textbook, taking snippits of code from it and testing it to make sure that my code would work
The skills that I feel will transfer into other courses will be my use of classes, parent and child classes.
I made this project readable and adaptable by using different files for every class.  This files can be copied and pasted into other projects, should the need arise.

Project 3 Software Design Template
This project we had a company, The Gamimg Room, come to our business to help expand their game to a web-based system for PC.  We were tasked in working through their constraints
and making recommendations on their way to move forward.  The parts that I worked on that I am proud is my in-depth responses to their needs.  Looking at multiple angles to make
sure that we were helping them make the right decision.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? - The document showed the specific needs from the user.  We had
to work within their boundaries to make sure we made the correct product.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? - I would look more into communicating with servers.  There
is so much information on the subjects that I would like to know about.  This would help me make a better decision when making a document for a client.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? -  I looked at their
specific needs and turned them into constraints.  I made sure that those needs were met first so that the final product will be to their needs the first time.  This makes a 
happy client and a successful business on our part.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? - My approach to designing
software to to make a list of the needs of the client.  Then I make one thing at time.  Once I am sure that section works, I move to the next section.  This way is a slow
process, but it hasn't failed.


CS360 - InventoryApp
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  -  In this course, we developed a mobile app for tracking Inventory.  The requirements of the app were to create a login page that required a username and password.  Then we were to create an inventory screen where we could show the items in in our inventory tracking.  Then we were also to create a page that requested SMS text messaging, so that when an inventory was low, we could send a text message to alert that stock was low.  This app was designed to replace a pen and paper style of inventory tracking.  This would keep tacking personal or company inventory in the palm of their hands.
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  -  The different screens and features that supported the users needs were the login screen for security, and the SMS request screen.  This would alert the user when a stock was low on inventory.  I tried to make the app to be a simple design for the user.  I tried to add an item and the inventory list on the same screen.  When an inventory needed to be updated, the user clicked on it on the list.  This would remove it from the list and it would be brought to the "add item" portion.  Then an inventory can be easily updated, then added back into the inventory.  this was successful to try to keep the inventory entering simple, easy and effective.
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  -  I coded my app one screen at a time.  I tested each portion with Toast messages.  When one screen was done, I made sure that I could transition to the next screen.  Then I coded the next screen.  The strategies I used were to reread my book and follow tutorials I found online.  The hard part is that the online tutorials were made in privous versions of Android Studio.  I had to adjust to current settings.  These same strategies can be applied in the future.  Trial and error.  As Thomas Edison said "I didn't fail 40,000 times.  I simply found 40,000 ways that creating a lightbulb WOULDN'T work.
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  -  I Testd all code with Toast messages.  When I tested for functionality, I checked to see if a toast message appeared and if it was the proper message.  This helped me make sure that I was on the right path.  Especially with the database.  This showed me that my databases were successful when I made them.
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  -  I think I innovated the most when it came to designing the screens.  I tried to keep it simple so that my coding wouldn't have to be as complex.  If I increased the complexity of my design, it would have done the same with my code, which would have led to more work than the 15 hours I spent on the app.
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  -  I feel that my most successful was creating the SQLiteDatabase.  I had the most fun with that.  It was fun to create the table column and then add and remove those items.  It has been a few terms since I worked with Java.  Luckily, there are alot of online references.
  
  
CS255 - Business Requirement Document and System Design Document
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  -  DriverPass was a new startup that wanted to change the way that training for a driver's test was done.  We were to design a system that would allow a user to log in and search thru available packages.  Once a package was purchased, they could register for driving courses.  Depending on package, they could also view online classes and take practice tests.
What did you do particularly well?
  -  I feel that I did my best work with creating the Business Requirement Documents.  I tried to think of everything that I could that could be needed to make sure the app was successful.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  -  I would pick to revise my USE CASE diagram.  Although, I think that I had the major components, I think that I could have done a more extensive job with the work that DriverPass wanted.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  -  I interpeted the user's needs thru the use cases.  This shows how the user can navigate thru the system to fulfill their goals.  The user should always be an important asset to designing an app.  The goals is to increase the number of users and retain them.  If your system isn't compatible with their needs, they will find another app.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  -  When designing software, I try to create the products owners needs into functional requirements.  I try to design a system with those requirements and then make it easy for a user to navigate.  The best way, for me, to analyze and design a system is to write it down.  Reading from a document isn't the same as writing it.  I tend to remember more things when I have written it down.  I then try to transcribe those notes into a visual to be able to communicate to others.

CS305 - Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  -  The name of the client was Artemis Financial.  They had a desire to modernize its operations by implementing the most current and effective software security.  Our job was to add a checksum verification upon connection to the server.  We also generated a certificate and transferred Artemis Financial to HTTPS on port 443.
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  -  My best work was in creating the checksum verification.  I was able to encrypt a message using SHA-256 and create a unique hash for verification of connection.  The message was converted into hex for display.  It is important to code securely to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  Software security keeps users data confidential from potential threats.  It also keeps that data from being improperly updated and at the same time available to the user when it is needed.
What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
  -  The most challenging part was getting a secure connection on port 443.  The CA seem to do a thourough job of making sure that a certificate is valid and that the authors of a website are properly identified.  Attempting to bypass this security with a self-made certificate was a struggle.
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
  -  I approached the need for increased security layers by adding the checksum verification.  This will help make sure that a session is unique to each user, while, simultaneously, making sure that the checksum generated is not able to be guessed by an intruder.  I would use a static testing tool like the Maven dependency check to assess vulnerabilities to determine mitigation techniques.
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  -  The way to ensure that the code was secure was to run a dependency check thru Maven and view the vulnerabilities that were found.  This report has many false positives so it is important to supress vulnerabilities that do not pertain to the current project.  The best way to determine if new vulnerabilities were introduced would be to run the dependency check again after refactoring to make sure that no new items were added to the report.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  -  The resource that I would use would be the Maven dependency check and the report that it generates.  This scoures through the NIST Vulnerability Database for dependencies with reported flaws.  These flaws can then be mitigated.  The practice that I use would be to secure inputs from a user to make sure the program was secure.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
  -  I would show the use of the static testing tool, Maven and the vulnerability report that it shows.  Then I would also show my supression of false positives.  I would also like to demonstrate my ability to create a checksum verification on a static message.


CS340 Final Dashboard code and README file
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  -  The way that I created code was to create it to be as re-usable as possible.  I created functions that could be used in different applications with minimal changing to adapt to a new project.  The background program that we created was a CRUD component to MongoDB.  We were able to interact with the database in python to Create, Read, Update and Delete.  This made the second project easier as we could import that module without having to recreate the code.  This CRUD module can be used again in future projects by changing the database that is being accessed, then it can be used.
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  -  As a computer scientist, I try to break down a problem into different managable components.  After they are broken down, I try to work on one at a time.  I then combine my code to make sure that all functions work together.  I think that this approach works well and makes the project seem more manageable as you are not overwhelmed by trying to do too many things at once.  This also helps when getting requirements from a client.  We can take their needs and break them down into managble working modules that will solve their problems.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  -  Computer Scientists write code and develop applications to solve problems and prepare for the future.  This can make a large project run faster and with less downtime to make a company more effective.  A company that can adapt to an ever-changing environement has a better chance of succeeding.  In our example, rather than scouring through a database by hand, we were able to create a program to go thru this database in seconds for exact animals that we were looking for.
